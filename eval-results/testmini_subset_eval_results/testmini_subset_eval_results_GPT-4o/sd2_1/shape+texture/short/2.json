  "model_output": "Yes, there is a necklace in the scene. It is attached to the green object resembling a watermelon rind.\nNo, the necklace is not round in shape. The chain follows a curved path but is not entirely round.\nYes, there is a watermelon in the scene. It appears cut open with a solid pink interior typical of watermelons.\nNo, the watermelon is not oblong in shape. The visible cut reveals a circular slice, though the green object has an oblong form.\nNo, the round necklace is not rubber-textured. The texture seems metallic or plastic rather than rubber."
