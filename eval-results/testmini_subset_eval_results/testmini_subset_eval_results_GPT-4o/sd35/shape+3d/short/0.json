  "model_output": "Yes, there is a mirror in the image because there is a reflective surface showing the ring's reflection.\nYes, there is an engagement ring in the image as the ring has a large central gemstone typical of engagement rings.\nYes, the mirror is oval because it has an elongated circular shape.\nNo, the ring is not in a diamond shape as the central stone appears to be an oval cut, not diamond-shaped geometrically.\nYes, the mirror is behind the ring because it is positioned in the background, with the ring in front of it on a reflective surface."
