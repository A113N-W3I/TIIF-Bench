The rose in the image does not have a fabric-like texture.  \nNo, the image does not present a comparison logic: there is only one rose in full bloom, and it is not compared to a not fully bloomed rose.  \nNo, there is no not fully bloomed rose in the image; therefore, it cannot have a metallic texture.  \nNo, the blooming rose is not fabric in texture; it has a natural appearance indicative of a real rose.
