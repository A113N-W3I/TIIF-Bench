It is visible on the left side.  \nNo, there is no notebook in the image; what appears to be a notebook is a CGI illusion.  \nNo, the insulated cup and notebook are not on the same desk due to the digital joining surface.  \nYes, the insulated cup appears to be metallic in texture, as it has a shiny surface.  \nNo, the notebook is not fabric in texture; it is a CGI regular book placed in the image.
