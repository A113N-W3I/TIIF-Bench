  "model_output": "yes, the image shows a 3D illustration of a toilet as it exhibits characteristics of a digital model rather than a real-world photo.\nyes, the illustration features rounded edges and smooth, soft forms with simplified geometry, evident in the curvy, polished silhouette of the toilet.\nyes, the color palette is limited to soft beige, light gray, and warm orange; warm orange is prominently used on the toilet seat, serving as the focal color.\nyes, the shading and gradients are soft, with smooth transitions that avoid harsh shadows or highlights, maintaining a subtle blend in the illustration.\nyes, the lighting is soft and diffused, coming from above and slightly to the right, as observed by the shadow on the lower-left side of the toilet.\nyes, the toilet is presented as a single, central object displayed in isolation with ample negative space around it.\nyes, the toilet is slightly angled to give a three-dimensional feel without extreme depth, aligning it with the intended perspective.\nyes, the background is a solid, muted color that complements the object without distraction, enhancing the focus on the toilet.\nno, there is no minimalistic, sans-serif typography placed in the bottom-left corner with small, subtle text in gray visible in the image.\nyes, the rendering style features a 3D render with simplified, low-poly aesthetics, characterized by the smoothness and simplified shape of the object."
