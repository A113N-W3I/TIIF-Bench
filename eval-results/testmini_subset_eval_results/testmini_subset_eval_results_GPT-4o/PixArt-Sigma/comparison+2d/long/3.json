  "model_output": "Yes, the image shows a mechanical keyboard as it features visible individual keys and switches typical of mechanical keyboards.\nYes, there is a clear protective pouch covering the keyboard in the image.\nNo, the image does not present a comparison logic as it only shows one keyboard with a clear protective pouch and does not compare it with another keyboard without a pouch.\nNo, since there is only one keyboard depicted in the image, the question of one being on top of the other does not apply."
