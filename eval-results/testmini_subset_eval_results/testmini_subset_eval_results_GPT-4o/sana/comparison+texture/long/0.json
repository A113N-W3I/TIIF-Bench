The rose appears to be stylized digitally rather than made of fabric.\nno, the image does not present a comparison logic with a fully bloomed rose being higher or lower than a not fully bloomed one. Only one rose is prominently visible and it's in full bloom.\nno, the not fully bloomed rose is not metallic in texture as it does not appear in the image.\nno, the blooming rose is neither fabric in texture nor metallic; it appears digitally stylized."
