  "model_output": "yes, the image shows a 3D illustration of a toilet as part of an abstract composition.\nno, the illustration does not feature rounded edges and smooth, soft forms with simplified geometry; it is more complex and composed of many small shapes.\nno, the color palette is not limited to soft beige, light gray, and warm orange, even though these colors are prominent.\nyes, shading and gradients are soft, with smooth transitions, even though the style is abstract.\nno, the lighting is not coming from above and slightly to the right; it is difficult to determine due to the abstract nature.\nno, the toilet is not presented as a single, central object displayed in isolation; it is mixed with other abstract forms.\nno, the toilet is not slightly angled; the perspective and depth are abstract and not easily discernible.\nno, the background is not a solid, muted color but an intricate pattern of shapes and colors.\nno, there is no minimalistic, sans-serif typography placed in the bottom-left corner.\nno, the rendering style does not feature a 3D render with simplified, low-poly aesthetics; it is more detailed and abstract."
