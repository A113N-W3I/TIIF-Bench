The oven contains a loaf of bread.\nNo, the image does not necessarily present a comparison logic: bread baking in the oven holds more promise than the bread already on the table. The image does not give clear evidence of such a comparison; it simply shows both bread on the table and bread in the oven.\nYes, the oven is behind the table. The oven is positioned at the back."
