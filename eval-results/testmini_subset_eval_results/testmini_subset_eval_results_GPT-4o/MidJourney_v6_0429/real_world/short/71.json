  "model_output": "Yes, the image shows a 3D illustration of a toilet with rounded edges because the toilet has a smooth and curved design typical of rounded edges.\nYes, the color palette of the image includes soft beige, light gray, and warm orange with warm orange used as an accent because these colors are clearly present in the composition.\nYes, the lighting is soft and diffuse, coming slightly from above and to the right because the shadows and highlights indicate such lighting placement.\nYes, the image has a matte and smooth surface texture with low reflectivity because there is no evident gloss or shine on the surfaces.\nNo, the toilet is not centered in the composition with ample negative space around it because it is positioned closer to the right side with minimal negative space nearby.\nYes, the perspective is slightly tilted to provide a moderate sense of three-dimensionality because the angle reveals depth and curvature effectively.\nYes, the background is a solid, low-saturation color that complements the subject because the beige and soft tones provide a cohesive and minimal backdrop.\nNo, there is no minimalist sans-serif typography positioned in the lower-left corner because no text is visible in that location.\nNo, the typography in gray text with low contrast against the background is absent because there is no typography in the image.\nNo, there is no gray text in the image because the visual content does not include any textual elements."
