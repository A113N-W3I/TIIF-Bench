  "model_output": "Yes, the image does show a 3D illustration of a toilet.  \nYes, the illustration features rounded edges and smooth, soft forms with simplified geometry.  \nNo, the color palette does not include warm orange; it consists of various shades of beige.  \nYes, the shading and gradients are soft, with smooth transitions avoiding harsh shadows or highlights.  \nNo, the lighting is not specifically coming from above and slightly to the right; it appears more diffused evenly.  \nYes, the toilet is presented as a single, central object displayed in isolation with ample negative space.  \nNo, the toilet is directly front-facing rather than angled for a 3D feel.  \nYes, the background is a solid, muted color that complements the object without distraction.  \nNo, there is no minimalistic, sans-serif typography placed in the bottom-left corner with small, subtle text in gray.  \nNo, the rendering style is not low-poly; it leans more toward a realistic 3D render."
