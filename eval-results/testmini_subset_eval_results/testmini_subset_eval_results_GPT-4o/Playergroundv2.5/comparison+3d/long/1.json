The oven is open, and the bread appears to be in the process of baking.\nNo, the image does not present a comparison logic: bread baking in the oven holds more promise than the bread already on the table. The image shows bread in the process of baking without implying a comparison.\nYes, the oven is behind the table, as the image shows the bread on the table with the oven in the background."
