  "model_output": "Yes, there is a ballerina in the image. The image shows a person wearing a ballet dress and standing in a ballet pose.  \nYes, there is an iceberg in the image. A large mass of ice is visible in the background that resembles an iceberg.  \nNo, there is not a ship in the image. There are no visible ships in the image.  \nNo, the ballerina is not pirouetting on the iceberg. The ballerina is standing on a flat surface that appears to be ice, not on the iceberg itself.  \nNo, there is no ship, so it cannot be behind the iceberg."
