  "model_output": "No, the image shows two toilets but does not match a singular centered 3D illustration with rounded edges.  \nYes, the color palette includes soft beige, light gray, and warm orange, with warm orange used as an accent.  \nYes, lighting is soft and diffuse, coming slightly from above and to the right.  \nYes, the image has a matte and smooth surface texture with low reflectivity.  \nNo, the toilet is off-center, and there are other elements, so it does not display ample negative space around a single toilet.  \nYes, the perspective is slightly tilted to provide a sense of three-dimensionality.  \nYes, the background is a solid, low-saturation color that complements the subject.  \nNo, there is no minimalist sans-serif typography in the lower-left corner.  \nNo, there is no gray text with low contrast against the background.  \nNo, there is no gray text in the image.
