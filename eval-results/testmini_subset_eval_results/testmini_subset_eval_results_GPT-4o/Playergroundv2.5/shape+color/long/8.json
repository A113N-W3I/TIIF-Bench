  "model_output": "No, there is no crystal wand in the scene. The scene only shows a spherical object on a stand and does not display a wand-like item.\nNo, the crystal wand is not spherical in shape. A wand is typically elongated and cylindrical, whereas the spherical shape belongs to the object depicted, possibly a crystal ball.\nNo, there is no snowball in the scene. The object shown is a spherical and looks like a decorative crystal or glass orb rather than a snowball.\nYes, the snowball is spherical in shape. Although there is no snowball present, the spherical object in the image is indeed spherical.\nYes, the spherical object in the image is blue, which matches the description provided for a blue snowball, even though it is likely not a snowball."
