There is a spherical red object that appears to be a ball.\nNo, the image does not present a comparison logic where the green ball is bigger than the red ball. The green object is larger than the red ball, but it is not identified as a ball.\nNo, it cannot be determined if the green ball is made of rubber since it is not clearly identified as a ball.\nNo, it cannot be determined if the red ball is made of wood as material identification is not provided visually."
