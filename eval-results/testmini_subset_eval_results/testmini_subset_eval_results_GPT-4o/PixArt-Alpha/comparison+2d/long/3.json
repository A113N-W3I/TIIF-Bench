  "model_output": "Yes, there are mechanical keyboards in the image. The visible keyboard has the design features typical of a mechanical keyboard, such as raised keycaps and distinct switches.\n\nYes, there is a clear protective pouch in the image. The keyboard is encased in a transparent pouch.\n\nNo, the image does not present a comparison logic: a mechanical keyboard with a clear protective pouch being newer than a mechanical keyboard without a clear pouch. There is no second keyboard visible to establish a comparison.\n\nNo, the newer mechanical keyboard is not on the bottom of the older one. Only one keyboard is visible in the image, so this cannot be assessed."
