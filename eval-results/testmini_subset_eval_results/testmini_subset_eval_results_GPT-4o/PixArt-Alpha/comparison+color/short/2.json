There is no expression or indication of anger visible in either frog.\nNo, the angrier frog is not yellow in color. Neither of the frogs appears to be angry, so the concept of which one is angrier does not apply.\nNo, the less angry frog is not black in color. Neither of the frogs appears to be angry, so the concept of which one is less angry does not apply."
