  "model_output": "yes, because the image clearly shows a toilet in a 3D representation.\nyes, because the toilet in the illustration has rounded edges and smooth, simplified forms.\nyes, as the colors used are soft beige and light gray, with warm orange as the focal color.\nyes, because the shading and gradients are soft with smooth transitions, avoiding harsh shadows or highlights.\nyes, as the lighting appears soft and diffused, coming from above and slightly to the right.\nno, because there is another object present and not much negative space.\nyes, as the toilet is slightly angled to suggest a three-dimensional feel.\nyes, because the background is a solid, muted color that does not distract from the object.\nno, there is no noticeable typography placed in the bottom-left corner of the image.\nno, the style does not feature a simplified, low-poly aesthetic typical of 3D renders but is detailed."
