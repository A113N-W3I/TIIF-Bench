  "model_output": "No, there is no soccer ball in the image; the object resembling a soccer ball is actually a pendant light or ceiling lamp.\nYes, there is an ottoman in the image; there are two ottomans, one orange and one blue.\nNo, the soccer-ball-like object is a pendant light and not an actual soccer ball, so the question about its sphericity as a ball is irrelevant.\nNo, the ottomans are not cubic in shape; they have a round, pouf-like shape.\nNo, there is no soccer ball in front of the ottoman, as the object resembling a soccer ball is a hanging pendant light."
