  "model_output": "yes The first panel depicts a small snail sitting at the edge of a counter in what appears to be a car dealership, engaging with a human who seems like a salesman, indicated by the setting and their interaction.\nyes The second panel features a close-up view of the snail, with a serious expression and text bubbles conveying its request for a fast sports car with large 'S's painted on various parts.\nyes The third panel includes the salesman with a hand scratching his head, showing confusion as he responds about the unusual customization requested by the snail.\nno The fourth panel displays a red sports car moving along the road with 'S' markings, but the reactions of people are not accurately described in the question; they appear surprised or puzzled rather than specifically pointing and laughing.\nyes There is a white padding along the borders of the comic, separating it from the edges of the panel and providing a clean look to the comic strip.\nyes The comic strip is structured with four distinct panels, each contributing to the progression of the story."
