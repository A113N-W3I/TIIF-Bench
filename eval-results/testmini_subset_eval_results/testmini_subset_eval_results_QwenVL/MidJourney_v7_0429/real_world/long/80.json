  "model_output": "yes There is a character depicted with what appears to be an aura around them, which could suggest grading.\nno The image includes multiple cards stacked and presented against a backdrop, not cropped as a single real card.\nno The title at the top reads \"GUMAII CAPYT,\" not \"GNRLYXYZ.\"\nno Since \"GNRLYXYZ\" is not present, \"1/1\" cannot be directly below this non-existent title.\nyes A barcode is visible on the card at the upper deck.\nno The grade label is not at the top but rather at the bottom near the edges of the card in the lower stack.\nyes Below the right-side grading label, a numericgrade (X-YII) is displayed.\nyes Underneath the numeric grade, there seems to be alphanumerics, which could represent the certification number.\nno Text sizes vary; the title is larger than other text elements.\nno Padding between borders and text differs, especially considering the barcode placement.\nyes The entire display is placed on a white background.\nno Text and labels are clearly present on the cards, both on the character card and the grading card."
