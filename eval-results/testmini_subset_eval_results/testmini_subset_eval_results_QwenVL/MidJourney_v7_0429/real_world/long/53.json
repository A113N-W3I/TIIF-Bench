  "model_output": "yes The image displays a card with text related to an event which is characteristic of a wedding invitation.\nno While the card appears to have a textured finish typical for fine stationery, there's no visible evidence of embossing or eggshell textures.\nno The decorations on the card appear to use floral motifs rather than abstract representations of a couple.\nno The card includes a variety of symbols like plants and patterns which adds to the design depth, not minimalistic in terms of iconography.\nno There is no text specifically mentioning the union of Image and Text on the invitation.\nno The text layout and font choices suggest a artistic typesetting but it does not perfectly align in some parts affecting readability slightly.\nyes The invitation card is indeed placed on a surface with a wood grain texture, likely a wooden desk.\nno Some words and phrases on the invitation are jumbled or do not make sense, making them unclear and unreadable.\nno The image does not contain any date, let alone specify March 25, 2025."
