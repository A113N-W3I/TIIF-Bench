  "model_output": "no The image does not depict any character with a visible aura grading.\nno The image is not cropped; it shows a collection of images within a larger layout.\nno There is no label at the top titled 'GNRLYXYZ'.\nno As there is no 'GNRLYXYZ' title, '1/1' is not displayed directly beneath it.\nno Since there is no '1/1' under 'GNRLYXYZ', there cannot be a barcode underneath.\nno The structure of the described label does not match what's present in this image.\nno With out a label as described, there can't be a numeric grade present.\nno No certification number can be found in the described format.\nno Text sizes and styles vary across the different sections.\nno Padding varies as text alignment and design differ in each section.\nno The overall background is not white but appears textured like paper.\nno The display includes various texts and labels on the images."
