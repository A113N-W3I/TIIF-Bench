  "model_output": "no The image does not depict a snail at a car showroom; it shows anthropomorphic turtles in what appears to be a kingmaker tournament setting.\nno There is no snail character present; the second panel features text about Mary telling someone they can participate in the tournament as aFGG.\nno The third panel continues with text related to the tournament rather than a salesman's reaction to customizing a car with 'S's.\nno The fourth panel shows a turtle wearing a shower cap in an emperor's chair, not a sports car speeding down a highway with 'S's painted on it.\nno There is no visible padding around the border of the comic strip panels.\nyes This comic strip consists of four individual panels arranged in a two-by-two grid layout."
