  "model_output": "no The image features a character but there is no indication of an aura grading.\nno The image is not cropped to resemble the size of a real card; it appears to be a character illustration on a plain background.\nno There is no label at the top with the title 'GNRLYXYZ'.\nno Since there is no 'GNRLYXYZ' title, there cannot be a '1/1' displayed below it.\nno There is no barcode visible in the image.\nno There is no grade label present in the image.\nno There is no numeric grade on a scale displayed within the image.\nno Since there is no numeric grade, there can't be a certification number displayed below it.\nno The text in the image includes varying sizes, such as the '100%' and other elements.\nno The text does not exhibit balanced padding from the border.\nno The background of the image is not white; it's a gradient of dark green to lighter green.\nno Text and labels (like '100%ootceray') are present on the display."
