  "model_output": "yes This is a 3D illustration depicting a toilet.\nyes The toilet has rounded edges and smooth forms with simplified geometry typical for such illustrations.\nyes The image uses soft beige and light gray for the toilet, with warm orange as an accent on the wall附件.\nyes The shading and gradients are indeed soft with smooth transitions.\nyes The lighting appears soft and diffused from above and slightly to the right.\nyes The toilet is presented as a single, central object with ample negative space around it.\nyes The toilet is slightly angled to provide a three-dimensional effect with moderate depth.\nyes The background is a solid, muted color that complements the toilet without causing distraction.\nno There is no visible typography in the bottom-left corner of the image.\nno The rendering style does not feature low-poly aesthetics but rather smooth surfaces and detailed geometry."
