  "model_output": "yes The image depicts a toilet with a curved design that suggests rounded edges.\nyes The image primarily uses soft beige for the toilet, light gray for the walls, and a warm orange circle as an accent.\nyes The lighting in the scene is soft and appears to come from above and to the right, creating gentle shadows.\nyes The surfaces in the image appear matte and smooth, with minimal reflections indicating low reflectivity.\nyes The toilet is positioned centrally with a significant amount of empty space around it.\nyes The perspective is not straight on, but angled slightly to enhance the three-dimensional appearance of the toilet.\nyes The background consists of solid, muted colors that do not compete with the main subject.\nno There is no visible text in the lower-left corner of the image.\nno Since there is no text in the image, there cannot be text with low contrast.\nno As previously stated, there is no text in the image."
