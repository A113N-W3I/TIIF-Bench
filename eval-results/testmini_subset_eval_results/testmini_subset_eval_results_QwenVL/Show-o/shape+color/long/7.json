  "model_output": "yes The image clearly shows an ice cream cone holding a scoop of yellow ice cream topped with a flower resembling a sunflower.\nyes The bottom part of the ice cream holder is distinctly conical and resembles a typical waffle ice cream cone.\nyes There is a flower on top of the ice cream that has characteristics of a sunflower, such as its large petals and center.\nno Although the flower may resemble a sunflower, it does not have a noticeable height as it's placed on top of the ice cream; therefore, its shape cannot be described as tall in this context.\nyes The cone of the ice cream is depicted in a dark color, consistent with what might be perceived as black for an ice cream cone wrapper or cone material."
