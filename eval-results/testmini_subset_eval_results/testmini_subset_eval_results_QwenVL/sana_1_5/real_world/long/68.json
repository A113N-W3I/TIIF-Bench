  "model_output": "yes The image clearly depicts a 3D rendered toilet.\nyes The toilet's design includes rounded edges and smooth forms with a simple geometric structure.\nyes The color scheme is primarily soft beige, light gray, and uses warm orange as a key color for emphasis.\nyes The shading and gradients are gentle with smooth transitions and lack sharp shadows or highlights.\nyes The lighting appears soft and diffused, originating from above and to the right side.\nyes The toilet is the sole focus and is shown against an uncluttered background with plenty of negative space.\nyes The perspective is slightly angled to enhance the sense of three-dimensionality subtly.\nyes The background is a solid, muted orange that does not distract from the toilet.\nno There is no visible typography in the bottom-left corner with small, subtle gray text.\nyes The overall style of the image is characterized by a 3D render with a simplified, low-poly look."
