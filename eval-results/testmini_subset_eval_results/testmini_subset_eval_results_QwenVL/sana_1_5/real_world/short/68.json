  "model_output": "yes The image clearly shows a 3D illustration of a toilet.\nyes The toilet is depicted with smooth, rounded edges and simplified geometric forms.\nyes The colors used are primarily soft beige, light gray, and warm orange, with the warm orange being prominent on the bowl area.\nyes The shading and gradients are indeed soft with smooth transitions, which is characteristic of this illustration style.\nyes The lighting appears soft and diffused, coming from a source above and slightly to the right.\nyes The toilet is centrally positioned with significant negative space around it.\nyes The toilet is angled at a slight angle, providing a three-dimensional view without excessive depth.\nyes The background is a solid, muted color that complements but does not distract from the main object.\nno There is no visible typography anywhere in the image, including the bottom-left corner.\nyes The 3D render has a simplified, low-poly aesthetic which contributes to its contemporary design."
