  "model_output": "yes The image clearly shows a 3D rendered toilet with smooth contours.\nyes The toilet has a modern design with curves and smooth surfaces rather than sharp edges.\nno The primary colors are soft beige and light gray with no warm orange present.\nyes The shading is very subtle with no sharp contrasts, indicating soft gradients.\nyes The light source appears to be above and to the right, casting mild shadows consistent with this direction.\nyes The toilet is the sole subject in the center with a lot of surrounding empty space.\nyes The toilet is positioned at a slight angle offering a three-dimensional perspective.\nyes The background is a uniform, muted tone that does not detract from the toilet.\nno There is no visible text on the image, especially not in the bottom-left corner.\nno The model appears to be detailed rather than having a low-poly aesthetic."
