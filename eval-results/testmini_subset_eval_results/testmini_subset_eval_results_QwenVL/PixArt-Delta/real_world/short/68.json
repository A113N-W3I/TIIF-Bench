  "model_output": "yes The image depicts a 3D illustration of a toilet.\nyes The toilet has rounded edges and smooth forms with a simple geometric design.\nyes The colors include soft beige, light gray, and warm orange, with warm orange being prominent.\nyes The shading and gradients are indeed soft with smooth transitions and lack harsh shadows or highlights.\nno The lighting does not appear to come from slightly to the right; it seems more centralized above.\nyes The toilet is the sole focus and is shown with plenty of negative space around it.\nyes The angle of the toilet provides a three-dimensional perspective without creating deep depth.\nno The background is not a solid, muted color but rather a gradient from pink to white.\nno There is no typography present in the image at all.\nno The styles do not indicate a low-poly aesthetic; instead, it appears smoother."
