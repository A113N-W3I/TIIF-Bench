  "model_output": "yes The image shows a toilet with rounded edges indicating a 3D rendering.\nyes The colors include soft beige, light gray, and warm orange for the lid which serves as an accent.\nyes The soft shadows suggest a light source from above and to the right creating a diffuse effect.\nyes The surface appears matte and smooth with little to no reflection.\nyes The toilet is placed centrally with significant space around, indicating a balanced composition.\nno The perspective is not tilted but rather a direct side view that still provides depth.\nyes The background is a uniform low-saturation color that does not detract from the toilet.\nyes There is minimalistic text \"TOILET\" in the lower-left corner in a sans-serif font.\nno The word \"TOILET\" has good contrast and isn't in low-contrast gray text.\nyes There is gray text visible in the word \"TOILET\"."
