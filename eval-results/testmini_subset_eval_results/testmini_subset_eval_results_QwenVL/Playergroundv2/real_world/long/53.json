  "model_output": "yes This image shows an ornate card which is likely a wedding invitation based on its design and layout.\nno The card has intricate lace-like cut-out details rather than being hefty with eggshell textures and embossings.\nno The decorations are botanical and floral representations, not abstract forms representing the couple.\nno The card features elaborate cut-out designs around the edge, which is not minimalist but rather detailed and decorative.\nno The specified text about the union of Image and Text is not present; instead, it appears to have placeholder or generic text.\nno The typesetting is not perfect as there are words like \"ofe\" and \"nveimt\" which seem incorrect or out of place.\nyes The card is indeed placed on what looks like a wooden surface with a natural finish, suggesting a tasteful wooden desk.\nno The text contains some words that are not clear and seem incorrect, such as \"ofe\" and \"seret,\" making it not fully readable.\nno There is no mention or indication of a specific date such as March 25, 2025, on the invitation."
