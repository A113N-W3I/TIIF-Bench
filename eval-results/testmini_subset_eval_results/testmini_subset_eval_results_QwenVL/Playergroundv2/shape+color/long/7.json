  "model_output": "yes There is an ice cream cone in the scene as it appears to be part of the main object which resembles a sunflower placed atop it.\nyes The ice cream cone is indeed conical in shape, maintaining the typical form associated with such containers for ice cream.\nyes A sunflower is present in the scene; it is depicted emerging from what looks like the top of an ice cream cone.\nno While the sunflower is not short, describing it as 'tall' is relative; here it's no taller than the cone, so it doesn't exceptionally stand out as tall.\nno The ice cream cone itself is not painted black; it has a waffle cone color and texture, typical of real-life cones."
