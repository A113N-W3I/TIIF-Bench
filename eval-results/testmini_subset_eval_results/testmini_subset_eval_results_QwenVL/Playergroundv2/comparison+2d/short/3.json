  "model_output": "no The image contains a single keyboard, not multiple ones that could include mechanical types.\nno There is no clear protective pouch; the transparent case appears to contain the whole computer and electronic components.\nno Since there's only one keyboard shown, there can't be a comparison between different keyboards regarding their age.\nno With only one keyboard presented, it's not possible for one to be on top of another."
