  "model_output": "yes The image shows a 3D toilet with rounded features typical of modern design.\nyes The colors used are predominantly soft beige for the surface, light gray for the vase, and warm orange for the wall and objects which act as accents.\nyes The shadows suggest a light source from above and to the right, giving a soft and diffuse appearance.\nyes The surfaces of both the toilet and surrounding objects appear matte with little to no reflections.\nyes The toilet is placed in the center of the image with enough space around to highlight it without distractions.\nyes The perspective includes a slight angle that helps to perceive depth and volume of the objects.\nyes The background uses a muted orange tone which works well with the off-white and gray of the toilet and other items.\nno There is no text present in the lower-left corner or anywhere else in the image.\nno Since there is no text in the image, it cannot be evaluated for contrast.\nno Without any text in the image, there is no presence of gray text to confirm."
