  "model_output": "yes This image shows a card with details typically found on a wedding invitation.\nno The card does not appear hefty; it seems thin with a print design rather than texture and embossing.\nyes There are elegant decorative elements like trees and small figures that could abstractly represent the couple or their relationship.\nno The use of iconography, including trees and figures, is not sparing; these elements are quite prominent in the design.\nno The text is complex and styled in an artistic manner but does not clearly specify \"the union of Image and Text.\"\nno The typesetting is artistic rather than strictly functional, which may affect clarity for some readers.\nyes The invitation card is shown placed on what appears to be a wooden desk.\nno The text features artistic styling and uses unconventional language which may not be universally clear or readable.\nyes The date \"March 25, 2025\" is mentioned in the \"Dress Code\" section, even though it is unusually placed there."
