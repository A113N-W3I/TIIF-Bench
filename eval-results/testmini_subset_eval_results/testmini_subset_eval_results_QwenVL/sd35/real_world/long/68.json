  "model_output": "yes The image shows a 3D illustration of a toilet with detailed features.\nyes The toilet has rounded edges and smooth forms with a simple geometric design.\nno The color palette includes white for the toilet, but it also features a prominent orange color in the background, not just soft beige and light gray.\nyes The shading and gradients are indeed soft with smooth transitions, and there are no harsh shadows or highlights on the toilet.\nyes The lighting appears soft and diffused, coming from above and slightly to the right, casting gentle shadows.\nyes The toilet is the sole focus and is centered with ample space around it.\nyes The toilet is positioned at a slight angle, enhancing its three-dimensional appearance without creating deep perspective.\nyes The background is a solid color that does not distract from the toilet but instead complements it.\nno There is no visible typography anywhere in the image.\nno The rendering style is realistic and not indicative of a simplified, low-poly aesthetic."
