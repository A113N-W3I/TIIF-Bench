  "model_output": "no The image features a character but does not show any aura grading.\n\nno The image appears to depict a collectible card-sized image rather than being precisely cropped like a real-world physical card.\n\nno The label at the top includes 'GLD NRLYXYZ', not 'GNRLYXYZ'.\n\nno Since 'GNRLYXYZ' is not present, '1/1' cannot be directly below it.\n\nno There is no barcode beneath '1/1', and '1/1' isn't present as described.\n\nno There is no grade label visible at the top right side of the label.\n\nno There is no numeric grade displayed below a grade label due to the absence of such a label.\n\nno There is no certification number displayed since the grading elements mentioned are not present.\n\nno The text on various parts of the label (title, descriptions) varies in size indicating non-uniformity.\n\nno The spacing (padding) between different text and the borders varies, showing unbalanced padding.\n\nyes The image displays a card against a plain white background.\n\nno The card has text and labels; it is not devoid of text or labels."
