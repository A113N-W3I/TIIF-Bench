  "model_output": "yes The image shows a 3D illustration of a toilet.\nyes The toilet has rounded edges and appears to have smooth, soft forms with simplified geometry.\nno The color palette includes soft beige and light gray but lacks a prominent warm orange; the interior suggests a darker shade implied but not warm orange.\nyes The shading and gradients appear soft without harsh shadows or highlights, indicating smooth transitions.\nyes The lighting seems to be soft and diffused, with shadows suggesting it comes from above and slightly to the right.\nno While the toilet is central, the background's textured appearance occupies significant space and does not leave ample negative space around the object.\nno The toilet does not appear slightly angled; it seems directly frontal.\nno The background has a textured rather than a solid, muted color, which actually distracts slightly from the object.\nno There is no visible text or typography within the image.\nno The style is not low-poly but rather a higher polycount, giving smoother surfaces."
