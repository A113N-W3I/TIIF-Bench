  "model_output": "yes This image depicts a 3D style toilet with a modern aesthetic.\nyes The toilet has a clean look with rounded and smooth contours.\nyes The image primarily features soft beige and light gray tones with a hint of warm orange inside the bowl, emphasizing simplicity.\nyes The lighting appears soft, creating gentle gradients and mild transitions.\nyes The illumination is consistent with a source positioned above and slightly to the right, casting subtle shadows.\nyes The toilet stands as the main object in focus with ample empty space around it.\nyes The object is not straight-on but slightly turned, giving it dimensionality while maintaining a minimalistic appearance.\nno The background includes textural elements like cracks, which adds some detail behind the toilet.\nno There is no visible text in the image at all.\nno The style is realistic rather than low-poly, with sufficient detailing for a modern, minimalist aesthetic."
