    "Does this image show a 3D illustration of a toilet? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Does the illustration feature rounded edges and smooth, soft forms with simplified geometry? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Is the color palette limited to soft beige, light gray, and warm orange, with warm orange used as the focal color? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Are the shading and gradients soft, with smooth transitions avoiding harsh shadows or highlights? Answer with yes or no.",

  "model_output": "no The image shows a 3D model of toilets, not an illustration.\nyes The toilets have rounded edges, smooth forms, and simplified geometry.\nno The color palette includes beige and soft white but does not include a prominent warm orange.\nyes The shading and gradients are soft with smooth transitions and lack harsh shadows or highlights.\nyes The lighting appears soft and diffused, seemingly coming from above and slightly to the right.\nno The image contains two toilet objects rather than a single, central object.\nno The toilets are not angled; they are presented in a straight-on perspective.\nno The background is a checkered pattern of mid-gray tones which is typical for modeling software.\nno There is no visible typography present in the image.\nyes The toilets are rendered in a 3D style with a simple, somewhat low-poly aesthetic."
