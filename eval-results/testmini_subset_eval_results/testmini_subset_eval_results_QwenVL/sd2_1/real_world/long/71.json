  "model_output": "yes because the image displays a 3D model of a toilet with smooth, rounded edges.\nno because the color palette primarily consists of a warm orange tone with no significant presence of soft beige or light gray.\nyes because the lighting appears soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows indicative of a light source from above and slightly to the right.\nyes because the surfaces of the toilet and the surrounding area exhibit a matte finish with minimal reflections.\nyes because the toilet is positioned centrally in the frame with considerable empty space surrounding it.\nyes because the perspective is angled, giving a clear view of the toilet's top and side, enhancing its three-dimensional form.\nyes because the background is a muted, desaturated color that harmonizes with the orange of the toilet.\nno because there is no visible text or typography present in the image.\nno because there is no gray text in the image; in fact, there is no text at all.\nno because there is no text present in the image, thus no gray text either."
