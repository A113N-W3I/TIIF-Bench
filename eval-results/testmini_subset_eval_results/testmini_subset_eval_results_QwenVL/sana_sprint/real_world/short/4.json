  "model_output": "no The infographic does not appear to include specific text indicating 'Survey Results on Podcasts'.\nyes The infographic uses a wide range of colorful sections which suggest vibrant colors.\nno There are no distinctly recognizable modern icons present within the design elements.\nno The text is too distorted and unclear to determine if clear typography has been used.\nno Key statistics, including listening frequency, are not clearly highlighted due to lack of clarity and specific data representations.\nno There is no distinct mention or indication of highlighted statistics based on devices used.\nno No specific popular topics are discernibly highlighted among the distorted elements.\nno Due to the disorganized and cluttered appearance, it cannot be described as clean.\nno The chaotic layout and unclear information prevent it from being considered professional.\nno The distortion and lack of focus make it difficult to read easily.\nno The text is unclear and not legible due to distortion.\nno The numbers included are not clear or legible because of the same distortion issue."
