  "model_output": "yes because the image shows two young women dressed as witches, who appear to be in their 20s based on their attire and hairstyle.\nyes because one of the witches has blonde hair with darker roots, resembling ash balayage.\nyes because the other witch is clearly depicted with long, wavy, auburn hair.\nyes because the urban setting, including brick buildings and signage, suggests they are on a city street in Williamsburg, NY.\nyes because both witches are in the foreground and are shown from behind, looking at a pole with signs.\nyes because both witches are focused on a post covered with various types of street signs.\nno because none of the signs mention anything about broom parking or witches.\nno because the signs do not include any reference to magic carpets or loading zones.\nno because there is no sign related to reindeer parking or a naughty list present.\nyes because one of the witches is holding a broomstick against her body.\nno because there is no indication that either witch is holding a magic carpet.\nyes because the background includes parked cars and multiple buildings along the street.\nyes because the pole holding the signs is indeed located on the right side of the street from the perspective of the witches.\nno because while some text on the signs is legible, much of it appears blurred or nonsensical."
