  "model_output": "no The image does not depict a grading of a character's aura.\nno The image is not a real physical card but appears to be a digital card representation with detailed illustrations and text.\nno The label at the top has text that is not clearly legible as 'GNRLYXYZ'.\nno Since the label does not contain 'GNRLYXYZ', it cannot display '1/1' below it.\nno There is no visible barcode beneath any text that reads '1/1'.\nno There is no grade label positioned on the right side of a label.\nno Given there is no grade label, there can't be a numeric grade displayed below it.\nno As there is no numeric grade, a certification number below it is absent.\nno The text appears in various sizes, indicating non-uniformity.\nno The padding around the text varies based on their respective spaces.\nyes The display appears against a white background.\nno The display contains multiple texts and labels, not empty of such elements."
