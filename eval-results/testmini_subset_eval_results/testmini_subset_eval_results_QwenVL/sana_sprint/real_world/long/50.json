  "model_output": "yes The first panel indeed shows a small snail across from a salesman in what appears to be a car showroom.\nno The second panel does not show a close-up of the snail; instead, it features two characters outside seemingly discussing the car that speeds past.\nno The third panel does not include the salesman scratching his head asking about the 'S's; it shows the red car passing pedestrians who comment on it.\nno The fourth panel is a static shot of the red car with people standing around it, not a dynamic scene of the car speeding down the highway with spectators reacting.\nno There is no visible padding around the border of this comic strip; the panels are directly adjacent to one another.\nyes This comic strip comprises four distinct panels that tell a sequential story."
