  "model_output": "yes There is a larger person in yellow clothing in the foreground.\nno There is no smaller person in a different color visible; both figures appear to be in similar tones.\nno The image does not clearly differentiate between a larger person in yellow and a smaller person in a different color as both figures seem to share similar coloring and there's no distinct smaller person.\nno The larger person in yellow clothing is not partially hidden by a smaller person; instead, the figures overlap in a way that suggests they are part of the same entity or one is a ghostly overlay of the other."
