  "model_output": "yes There is a character depicted, possibly with elements suggesting an aura, but it's not explicitly labeled as such.\nno The image does not appear to be cropped to the size of a real card; it looks to be digitally rendered and styled as a collectible game card.\nyes The label at the top indeed has the title 'GNRLYXYZ'.\nyes '1/1' is displayed directly below 'GNRLYXYZ' on the label, indicating its uniqueness.\nno There is no barcode placed beneath the '1/1'; instead, other text is present.\nno The grade label is not displayed on the right side of the label at the top; there's a diamond-shaped symbol instead.\nno There is no numeric grade or grade label visible in this image.\nno There is no certification number displayed below a numeric grade as there is no numeric grade present.\nno The text on the label varies in size, with '1/1' and 'GNRLYXYZ' being different in font size and style.\nno The padding from the border varies; some text like '1/1' has more space around it compared to the border than other elements.\nyes The display is placed on a white background, indicating a clear, isolated presentation.\nno The full display includes text and labels; it is not shown without any text."
