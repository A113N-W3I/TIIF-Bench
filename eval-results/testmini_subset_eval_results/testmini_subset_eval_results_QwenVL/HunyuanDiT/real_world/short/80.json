  "model_output": "no There is no character's aura being graded in the image.\nno The image does not appear to be cropped to the size of a real card; it is a full depiction of a character.\nno There is no label with the title 'GNRLYXYZ' visible in the image.\nno Since there is no 'GNRLYXYZ' label, '1/1' cannot be displayed below it.\nno There is no barcode present in the image.\nno There is no grade label present in the image.\nno There is no numeric grade or scale visible.\nno No certification number is present as there is no grading element.\nno The question is irrelevant as there is no label or text to assess uniformity.\nno There is no label or text to assess balanced padding against a border.\nno The display is not on a white background but has a light yellowish-green gradient.\nno The display includes the character with a background and no reference to a 'card' suggests a lack of such labels."
