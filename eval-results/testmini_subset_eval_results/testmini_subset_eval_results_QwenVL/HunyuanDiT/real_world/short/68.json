  "model_output": "no The image does not depict a toilet but rather an abstract, stylized design of a washing machine.\nno The image features a more complex geometry with sharp lines and detailed textures.\nno The color palette includes vibrant yellows, greens, blues, and pinks, which are not soft beige, light gray, or warm orange.\nno The shading and gradients are vivid and neon-like, with stark contrasts rather than soft transitions.\nno The lighting appears to be artificial and enhances the neon-like effect rather than being soft and diffused.\nno The object is not a toilet and is surrounded by a grid pattern in the background rather than being in isolation with negative space.\nno The object is a washing machine and while it has a three-dimensional appearance, it's not angled slightly as described.\nno The background is not a solid, muted color; it contains a dynamic grid pattern that complements the object.\nno There is no visible typography present in the bottom-left corner of the image.\nno The rendering style is not low-poly but rather high in detail with a high-resolution appearance."
