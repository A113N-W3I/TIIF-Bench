  "model_output": "yes The image shows a 3D illustration of an object resembling a toilet.\nyes The object has rounded edges and simplified geometry suggesting a soft form.\nno The color palette includes vibrant colors beyond just soft beige, light gray, and warm orange.\nno The shading and gradients appear harsh with vivid contrasts rather than smooth transitions.\nno The lighting is not soft and diffused but rather vibrant and varied across the object.\nyes The object is displayed centrally with significant surrounding negative space.\nyes The toilet is angled to provide a three-dimensional perspective.\nno The background has varied vibrant colors which distract from the object.\nno There is no visible typography present in the bottom-left corner.\nno The style does not exhibit low-poly aesthetics but rather a detailed, reflective surface."
