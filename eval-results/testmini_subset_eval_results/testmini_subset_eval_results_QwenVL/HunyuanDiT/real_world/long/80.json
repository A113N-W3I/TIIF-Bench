  "model_output": "no The image does not show a grading aura around the character.\nno The image is not cropped like a physical card but appears more as a digital illustration.\nno There is no label at the top with the title 'GNRLYXYZ'.\nno Since 'GNRLYXYZ' is not present, neither is '1/1' beneath it.\nno There is no barcode visible in the image provided.\nno There is no grade label present on the top right side of the label.\nno There isn't a visible numeric grade or a associated scale.\nno With no numeric grade, there is also no certification number displayed.\nno There are no visible labels or texts to evaluate uniformity of text size.\nno Without text presence, the concept of balanced padding cannot be assessed.\nno The display is against a gradient background, not a pure white.\nno The display includes a character and part of a window; hence it is not a blank display."
