    "Does this image show a 3D illustration of a toilet? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Does the illustration feature rounded edges and smooth, soft forms with simplified geometry? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Is the color palette limited to soft beige, light gray, and warm orange, with warm orange used as the focal color? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Are the shading and gradients soft, with smooth transitions avoiding harsh shadows or highlights? Answer with yes or no.",

  "model_output": "yes The image clearly shows a 3D-rendered toilet with a stylized design.\nyes The toilet has rounded edges and a geometric form that is simplified for a modern aesthetic.\nyes The colors used are primarily soft beige and light gray for the top part, while the warm orange is prominently featured at the base.\nyes The shading and gradients are indeed soft, with smooth transitions typical of high-quality 3D renders aiming to avoid sharp contrasts.\nyes The lighting appears to be soft and diffused, casting gentle shadows that suggest a light source from above and slightly to the right.\nyes The toilet is the sole focus of the image, centered with significant negative space around it, enhancing its prominence.\nyes The angle of the toilet provides a sense of three-dimensionality but avoids deep perspective to keep the focus on the design.\nyes The background is a solid, muted color which complements the toilet without drawing attention away from it.\nno There is no visible typography in the bottom-left corner or anywhere else in the image.\nno The 3D render does not exhibit low-poly aesthetics; instead, it displays smoothness and detail indicating a higher polygon count."
