  "model_output": "yes, the image clearly depicts a 3D illustration of a toilet.\nyes, the toilet's design incorporates rounded edges and smooth forms with a simplified geometric structure.\nyes, the colors used in the illustration are primarily soft beige, light gray, and warm orange, with the warm orange accentuating certain features.\nyes, the shading and gradients are applied softly, with smooth transitions lacking harsh shadows or highlights.\nyes, the lighting appears soft and diffused, originating from above and slightly to the right, creating gentle shadows.\nyes, the toilet is centrally located and presented in isolation against a plain backdrop with significant negative space around it.\nyes, the toilet is oriented at a slight angle, enhancing its three-dimensional appearance without creating excessive depth.\nyes, the background is a solid, muted color that harmonizes with the toilet without drawing attention away from it.\nno, there is no visible typography or text present in the image.\nno, while the image uses simplified aesthetics, the details suggest a higher poly count than typically associated with low-poly styles."
