  "model_output": "yes The image appears to display a 3D rendering of a toilet with smooth edges.\nyes The colors in the image consist of soft beige, light gray, and warm orange tones, with the orange serving as an accent color.\nno The lighting does not seem to come from above and to the right; it is more evenly distributed without a clear directional source.\nyes The surfaces in the image appear matte and smooth with minimal reflection.\nno The toilet is not centered and there is not ample negative space; instead, the surrounding objects are densely packed.\nno The perspective is not slightly tilted but rather straight-on or level with the subject.\nno The background is not a solid color but filled with complex shapes and patterns.\nno There is no visible typography in the image at all.\nno Since there is no typography, there cannot be gray text with low contrast.\nno There does not appear to be any gray text within the image."
