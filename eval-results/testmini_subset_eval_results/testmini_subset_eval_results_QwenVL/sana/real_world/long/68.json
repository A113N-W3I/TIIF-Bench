  "model_output": "no The image does not clearly show a 3D illustration of a toilet; it is heavily abstracted.\nno The illustration is abstract with fragmented pieces rather than rounded edges and smooth forms.\nyes The colors present include soft beige, light gray, and a warm orange.\nno The shading and gradients are not soft; the image has a complex, mosaic-like pattern with abrupt transitions.\nno The lighting cannot be determined due to the abstract nature of the image.\nno The toilet is not the focus; the image is filled with various patterns and objects.\nno The object is not distinctly angled due to the abstract design blending elements together.\nno There is no solid, muted background; the entire image is intricate and busy.\nno There is no visible typography in the image.\nyes The rendering style appears to have a simplified, low-poly aesthetics providing a fragmented appearance."
