  "model_output": "no The image does not clearly show a character with a graded aura.\nno The image does not appear to be cropped to resemble the size of a real card.\nno There is no clear label at the top with the title 'GNRLYXYZ'.\nno Since there is no 'GNRLYXYZ' label, '1/1' cannot be displayed beneath it.\nno There is no discernible barcode in the image.\nno There is no clearly visible grade label to determine its placement.\nno The absence of a grade label means there's no numeric grade below it.\nno Without a numeric grade displayed, a certification number cannot be present.\nno The text sizes in the image are not uniform due to distortion.\nno Padding between text and borders cannot be determined as the text is heavily distorted.\nno The display is not on a white background; it has a complex multicolored abstract backdrop.\nno The display includes distorted text and cannot be considered free of text or labels."
