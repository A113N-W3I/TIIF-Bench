  "model_output": "no The image features abstract shapes and patterns, not a 3D illustration of a toilet.\nno The image does not have a soft beige, light gray, and warm orange color palette; it has a chaotic mix of colors.\nno The lighting does not appear soft and diffuse; the image seems to lack discernible lighting effects due to its abstract nature.\nno The surfaces in the image do not have a matte and smooth texture; they are part of an abstract and possibly fractured design.\nno There is no toilet in the image, so it cannot be centered with negative space around it.\nno The image lacks a clear perspective; it is an abstract arrangement of shapes.\nno There is no solid, low-saturation background; the entire image is filled with complex patterns.\nno There is no visible typography on the image.\nno The image does not contain gray text, therefore, it cannot have low contrast against the background.\nno There is no gray text present in the image."
