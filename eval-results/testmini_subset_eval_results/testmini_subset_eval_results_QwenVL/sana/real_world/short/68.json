    "Does this image show a 3D illustration of a toilet? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Does the illustration feature rounded edges and smooth, soft forms with simplified geometry? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Is the color palette limited to soft beige, light gray, and warm orange, with warm orange used as the focal color? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Are the shading and gradients soft, with smooth transitions avoiding harsh shadows or highlights? Answer with yes or no.",

    "Is the toilet presented as a single, central object displayed in isolation with ample negative space? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Is the toilet slightly angled to give a three-dimensional feel without extreme depth? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Is the background a solid, muted color that complements the object without distraction? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Is there minimalistic, sans-serif typography placed in the bottom-left corner with small, subtle text in gray? Answer with yes or no.",
    "Does the rendering style feature a 3D render with simplified, low-poly aesthetics? Answer with yes or no."

  "model_output": "yes This image clearly illustrates a toilet with a 3D perspective.\nno The forms are not smooth; they are disrupted by chaotic, distorted edges.\nno While there are soft beige and light gray hues, warm orange is not prominent nor used as a focal color.\nno The shaders produce a highly distorted effect with pronounced highlights and shadows.\nno The lighting appears chaotic and does not follow a simple direction such as from above and to the right.\nno The toilet is not isolated; it is surrounded by a chaotic pattern of deformed shapes.\nno The chaotic background distorts the perception of depth, lacking a cohesive sense of dimensionality.\nno The background is cluttered with a complex pattern rather than a solid, muted color.\nno There is no visible typography in the image.\nno The aesthetic involves distortion and complexity rather than simplified, low-poly features."
