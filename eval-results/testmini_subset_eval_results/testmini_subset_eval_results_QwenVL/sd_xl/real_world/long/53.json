  "model_output": "yes The image clearly depicts an invitation card designed for a special occasion, most likely a wedding given the decorative style and formal presentation.\nno While the card has detailed engravings, it does not appear to have a texture suggestive of eggshell nor are there visible signs of embossing; the texture seems more akin to carved or printed designs.\nyes The card features intricate engravings that abstractly represent two figures, possibly the couple, in a stylized artistic form.\nno The use of iconography is quite extensive with detailed engravings throughout the card, rather than being sparing and minimalist.\nno The text on the card does not mention anything specific about the union of Image and Text; it appears to follow a traditional format for wedding invitations.\nno Typesetting appears slightly irregular, particularly with alignment issues at the bottom part of the text.\nyes The invitation card is placed on what appears to be a tasteful wooden surface resembling a desk.\nno Parts of the text on the card are not entirely clear and affect readability, especially the lower section which looks somewhat distorted.\nno There is no mention or display of time information for March 25, 2025, on the invitation card."
