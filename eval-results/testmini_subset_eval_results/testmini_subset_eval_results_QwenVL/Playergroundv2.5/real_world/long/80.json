  "model_output": "no There is no grading or aura assessment evident in the image.\nno The image appears to be a digital illustration and not cropped to resemble a physical card.\nno There is no visible label with the title 'GNRLYXYZ'.\nno Since there's no label titled 'GNRLYXYZ', '1/1' cannot be displayed below it.\nno Without a '1/1' designation, there can't be a barcode placed beneath it.\nno There is no label or grading system present on the image.\nno No grade label means there cannot be a numeric grade displayed.\nno Since there is no numeric grade, there can't be a certification number below it.\nno All text isnâ€™t present, so uniformity in size cannot be assessed.\nno With no text, assessing padding balance is not applicable.\nno The background of the image is dark, not white.\nno The display contains a name at the bottom, which contradicts the claim of having no text or labels."
