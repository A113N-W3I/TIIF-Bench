  "model_output": "yes There is a pair of sunglasses in the image.\nno There is no mirror in the image; instead, there is a reflective surface which could be mistaken for a mirror.\nno Since there is no mirror in the image, the sunglasses cannot be described as under a mirror.\nno The sunglasses are not white in color; they have green lenses and the frame appears to be light-colored but not strictly white.\nno There is no mirror in the image, so it cannot be described as green in color."
