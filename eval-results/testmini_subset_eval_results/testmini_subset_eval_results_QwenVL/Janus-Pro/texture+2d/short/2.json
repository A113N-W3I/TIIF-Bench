  "model_output": "no The object in the image resembles a tag or label, not a fork.\nno The image shows a piece of fabric with a tag, but it's not clear whether it's part of a shirt or another type of garment.\nno There is no fork present in the image, so its material cannot be assessed.\nyes The object in the image appears to be a piece of folded fabric, which is consistent with what a shirt would be made of.\nno There is no fork present in the image, therefore its position relative to the shirt cannot be determined."
