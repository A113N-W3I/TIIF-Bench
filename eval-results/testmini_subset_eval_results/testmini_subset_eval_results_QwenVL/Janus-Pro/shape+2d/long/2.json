  "model_output": "yes There is a coaster with a geometric pattern that could serve as a divider.\nno There is no can of soda visible; instead, there is a glass container.\nno The coasters present are not triangular but diamond-shaped.\nno Since there is no can of soda, this cannot be assessed; the glass container is not cylindrical at the base.\nno Since there is no can of soda and no triangular divider, this contextually does not apply."
