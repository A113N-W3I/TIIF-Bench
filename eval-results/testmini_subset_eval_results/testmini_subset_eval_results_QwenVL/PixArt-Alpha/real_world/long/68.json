  "model_output": "yes The image clearly shows a 3D illustration of a toilet.\nyes The toilet in the image has rounded edges and smooth, soft forms with simplified geometry.\nyes The color palette is indeed limited to soft beige for the toilet, light grayish floor, and warm orange for the background, with the orange serving as a focal color.\nyes The shading and gradients on the toilet are soft, with smooth transitions and no harsh shadows or highlights.\nyes The lighting appears to be soft and diffused, coming from an angle that suggests it is above and slightly to the right of the toilet.\nyes The toilet is the single, central object in the image, displayed in isolation with ample negative space around it.\nyes The toilet is slightly angled in the image, providing a three-dimensional feel without creating extreme depth.\nyes The background is a solid, muted orange color that complements the toilet without causing any distraction.\nno There is no visible typography in the bottom-left corner or anywhere else in the image.\nno The rendering style does not appear to use simplified, low-poly aesthetics; instead, it features smooth surfaces and more detailed geometry."
