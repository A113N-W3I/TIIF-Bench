  "model_output": "no The image does not appear to show a grading process of a character's aura.\nno The image is not formatted like a card and does not seem cropped to resemble one.\nno There is no label present at the top of the image with the title 'GNRLYXYZ'.\nno Since there is no such label, '1/1' is not displayed below any such title.\nno With no '1/1' text, there can't be a barcode beneath it.\nno There is no label at the top of the image for a grade label to be on the right.\nno Without a grade label or numeric grade, this cannot exist in the image.\nno As there is no numeric grade, a certification number would also not be present.\nno All text mentioned elements do not appear on the label hence not uniform in size.\nno Given there is no text or specific labeled area, balanced padding is not observed.\nno The background is not entirely white; it appears as a library setting.\nno Texts or labels as detailed in previous queries are not present but it's not full display."
