  "model_output": "yes The image clearly depicts a toilet with rounded edges which appears to be a 3D illustration.\nyes The color palette primarily consists of soft beige for the toilet, light gray for the floor, and warm orange as an accent for both the backrest and wall.\nno The lighting does not appear to be coming from above and to the right; shadows indicate lighting primarily from the front.\nno The surfaces of the toilet and other elements have a glossy appearance rather than a matte and smooth texture with low reflectivity.\nno While the toilet is somewhat central, the lack of surrounding space does not provide ample negative space around it.\nno The perspective is not tilted; the view is straight on, emphasizing the front of the toilet.\nyes The background is a solid, low-saturation warm orange that complements the beige color of the toilet.\nno There is no visible typography present in the image.\nno Given the absence of typography, there is no gray text to evaluate for contrast.\nno Since there is no text in the image, there cannot be gray text present."
