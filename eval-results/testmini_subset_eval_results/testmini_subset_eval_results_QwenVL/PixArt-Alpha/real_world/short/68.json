  "model_output": "yes The image clearly depicts a toilet with 3D modeling characteristics.\nyes The toilet has a modern design with no sharp corners, using simplicity in its forms.\nyes The colors used are primarily soft beige for the base and warm orange for accents, with light gray as a backdrop.\nyes The image employs soft shading techniques resulting in smooth gradients across surfaces.\nyes The light source appears to be from above and to the right, casting a gentle shadow beneath and to the left.\nyes The toilet is centered and surrounded by ample empty space, drawing focus solely to it.\nyes The angle provides a clear front and side view without causing the image to lose its flatness.\nyes The background is a plain, neutral tone that does not distract from the main subject.\nno There is no visible text or typographical elements in the bottom-left corner or elsewhere.\nno The style uses solid, full-form geometries rather than a low-poly approach."
