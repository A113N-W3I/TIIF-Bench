  "model_output": "no There is no magician depicted in the image.\nno There are rabbits, but they are dressed up and not being pulled out of a hat as expected in a typical magic trick.\nno There is no hat visible in the image.\nno The image does not show a magician pulling the rabbit.\nno Since there is no hat and no traditional magic trick setup, there is no rabbit being pulled from a hat.\nno The gloves appear to be part of the attire of the rabbit figures and do not seem to be made of leather.\nno There is no hat in the image, so it cannot be made of plastic."
