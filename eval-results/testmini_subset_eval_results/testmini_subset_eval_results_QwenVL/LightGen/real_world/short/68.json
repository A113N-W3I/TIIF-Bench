  "model_output": "yes The image clearly depicts a 3D illustration of a toilet.\nyes The toilet has rounded edges and uses simplified geometry with a smooth appearance.\nyes The image predominantly features soft beige, light gray, and a warm orange color which is notably used for the toilet bowl.\nyes The shading and gradients are indeed soft, avoiding any harsh shadows or highlights and providing smooth transitions.\nyes The lighting in the image appears to be soft and diffused, with the light source likely coming from above and slightly to the right.\nyes The toilet is the sole focus of the image and is displayed with a significant amount of negative space around it.\nyes The toilet is positioned at a slight angle, enhancing the three-dimensional effect subtly.\nyes The background is a uniform, muted color that provides a neutral backdrop complementing the toilet without drawing attention away from it.\nno There is no typography present in the bottom-left corner or anywhere in the image; it is absent entirely.\nno While the image has a 3D rendered look, it does not exhibit a low-poly aesthetic but rather a smooth, high-resolution surface quality."
